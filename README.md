Scratch Cloud Var is a nice concept. Have hosted server that can share integer between a game what ever the tech behind it. This tool is just an abstract layer pushing and receiving integer.

I have a Websocket server that allows to share integer between the game clients. 
But I could use Mirror, or Unity Network, or WebTransfort.

The stabilty of the how can be change through time.

What is not changing is the will to just send an integer between the clients of a multiplayer to make it easy.

In here you will find this abstract layer of just sending an receiving integer.
That you can hook later at the system you want to use.
